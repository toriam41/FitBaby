But so are many dark leafy greens, such as collard greens, kale, and spinach, as well as broccoli."

Tomatoes are also rich in a carotenoid called lycopene, a potent antioxidant. The lycopene in cooked and processed tomatoes (sauce, paste, salsa, canned tomatoes) is more easily absorbed than that in raw tomatoes. Watermelon and pink grapefruit also contain lycopene."
